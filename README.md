# React Application using Amazon S3 & CircleCi

In this tutorial we will build out a CI CD Pipeline with AWS and Circle CI. You will learn how to write a yaml configuration file to deploy your application to the cloud in a Continuous Integration, Deployment way. 

For this we will use a simple React Application. Firs we will setup our GitHub Repository, Circle CI Account and connect the Project to Circle CI. After that we can start writing the yaml configuration file that will hold all the instructions on how the app should be built and deployed. We will need to install things like the aws cli, build our app and then sync it to S3.
